# Player Leveling Simulator
This program randomly generates 1000 (this number can be changed by changing the preprocessor directive SIMSIZE) players each time you add a player to your hypothetical party. Players in your party can be leveled individually or collectively, to create a party that matches your needs. For example, you can make a party with a fifth-level druid, a fourth-level wizard, and a sixth-level monk.

After generating your desired party, you can analyze certain averages of each player or the party as a whole, including health, bonuses to checks (including mixed checks and checks with tools), saving throw modifiers, save DC's, and more. For example, you could compare your sixth-level monk's average bonus to Intelligence (nature) checks with calligrapher's tools to your party's average bonus, or you could just check average health totals.
